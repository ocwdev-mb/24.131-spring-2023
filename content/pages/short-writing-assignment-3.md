In class, we looked at two accounts of manipulation: according to Susser et al., manipulation involves “hidden influence”, whereas according to Robert Noggle, manipulation involves “leading somebody astray”. Your task is to assess which of these theories provides a better account of online manipulation by drawing on each theory to analyze the following example (assume that the “Stay in the Loop” box is checked by default):

You should, more specifically, submit a coherent piece of writing which answers the following:

1. According to Susser et al. (2019), what is manipulation?
2. On Susser et al.’s view, which features (if any) of the above example are manipulative?
3. According to Noggle (1996), what is manipulation?
4. On Noggle’s view, which features (if any) of the above example are manipulative?
5. Which account of manipulation does a better job of accounting for all and only those features of the above interface that influence user behavior in morally problematic ways?

Word Limit: 1250 (Submissions which exceed 1250 words will be penalized by one third of a letter grade per 100 words. Citations do not count toward the word limit.)

Writing Requirements: 

- This is a formal piece of writing but is not an essay. You do not need a formal introduction or conclusion and can mostly just answer the prompt.
- This time, however, you must have a thesis statement. You should explicitly state your thesis at the start of your paper by writing “Thesis:” and then stating your thesis.
    - Your thesis is the central claim you are arguing for in your paper. In this case, your thesis is your answer to question (5) in summary form.
- After explicitly stating your thesis, you should present a single, coherent piece of writing that, by answering questions (1) – (5), defends your thesis.

This assignment is due the end of day after session 19.
